<h3 style="text-align:left;">Key Findings:</h3>

The data analysis showed that a car's price is mainly influenced by its year of manufacture and mileage. The newer the car and the lower its mileage, the higher the price. Cars with automatic transmissions are more commonly found in higher price ranges, while cars with manual transmissions are generally priced lower. It was also observed that the car's condition and brand play a significant role in determining its price. For example, rare or collectible cars can still maintain a high value even if they are in poor condition.
